comment: The PHENIX Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured
  open heavy-flavor production in minimum bias Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$
  GeV via the yields of electrons from semileptonic decays of charm and bottom hadrons.
  Previous heavy-flavor electron measurements indicated substantial modification in
  the momentum distribution of the parent heavy quarks due to the quark-gluon plasma
  created in these collisions. For the first time, using the PHENIX silicon vertex
  detector to measure precision displaced tracking, the relative contributions from
  charm and bottom hadrons to these electrons as a function of transverse momentum
  are measured in Au+Au collisions. We use the bottom electron fractions in Au+Au
  and p+p along with the previously measured heavy flavor electron $R_{AA}$ to calculate
  the $R_{AA}$ for electrons from charm and bottom hadron decays separately.
