  BNL-RHIC. The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured the differential cross section, mean transverse momentum, mean transverse momentum squared of inclusive $J/\psi$  and cross section ratio of $\psi$ to $J/\psi$ at forward rapidity in $p$$+$$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=510 GeV via the dimuon decay channel. Comparison is made to inclusive $J/\psi$ cross sections measured at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV and 2.76-13 TeV. The result is also compared to leading-order nonrelativistic QCD calculations coupled to a color-glass-condensate description of the low-x gluons in the proton at low transverse momentum (p_T) and to next-to-leading order nonrelativistic QCD calculations for the rest of the p_T range. These calculations overestimate the data at low p_T. While consistent with the data within uncertainties above $\approx$3 GeV/c, the calculations are systematically below the data. The total cross section times the branching ratio is BR $\frac{d\sigma_{pp}^J/\psi }{dy}(1.2 < |y| < 2.2,0 < p_T < 10 GeV/c) = 54.3 pm 0.5(stat) pm 5.5(sys)nb$.
