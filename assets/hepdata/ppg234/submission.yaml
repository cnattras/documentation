  BNL-RHIC.  We present a measurement of the transverse single-spin asymmetry (TSSA) for $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ mesons in $p^\uparrow + p$ collisions in the pseudorapidity range $|\eta|<0.35$ and at a center-of-mass energy of 200 GeV with the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. In comparison with previous measurements in this kinematic region, these results have a factor of 3 smaller uncertainties. As hadrons, $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ mesons are sensitive to both initial- and final-state nonperturbative effects for a mix of parton flavors. Comparisons of the differences in their TSSAs have the potential to disentangle the possible effects of strangeness, isospin, or mass. These results can constrain the twist-3 trigluon collinear correlation function as well as the gluon Sivers function.

description: 'Data from Figs. 2, 4, and 5 of the transverse single-spin asymmetry of neutral pions measured at $|\eta|<0.35$ in $p^\uparrow$$+$$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV. An additional scale uncertainty of 3.4\% due to the polarization uncertainty is not shown. The total $\sigma_{\rm syst}$ in the lowest $p_T$ bin includes an additional systematic uncertainty of $1.06\times10^{-4}$ from bunch shuffling.'
