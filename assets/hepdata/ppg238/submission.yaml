comment: |
  BNL-RHIC. In 2015, the PHENIX collaboration has measured very forward ($\eta > 6.8$) single spin asymmetries of inclusive neutrons in transversely polarized proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions at a center of mass energy of 200 GeV. A previous publication from this data set concentrated on the nuclear dependence of such asymmetries. %Also proton-proton results at the same and different collision energies exist, but all provided transverse momentum integrated results over the acceptance of the forward neutron detectors. In this measurement the explicit transverse momentum dependence of inclusive neutron single spin asymmetries for proton-proton collisions is extracted using a bootstrapping unfolding technique on the transverse momenta. This explicit transverse momentum dependence will help improve the understanding of the mechanisms that create these asymmetries.
