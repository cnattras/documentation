comment: '
Flow coefficients $v_n$ for $n$ = 2, 3, 4, characterizing the
anisotropic collective flow in Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}~=~200$ GeV, are measured relative to event planes
$\Psi_{n}$, determined at large rapidity. We report $v_n$ as a
function of transverse momentum and collision centrality, and study
the correlations among the event planes of different order $n$.  The
$v_n$ are well described by hydrodynamic models which employ a
Glauber Monte Carlo initial state geometry with fluctuations,
providing additional constraining power on the interplay between
initial conditions and the effects of viscosity as the system
evolves.  This new constraint can serve to improve the precision 
of the extracted shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta/s$.
